Assignment: GitHub and Visual Studio
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of GitHub and Visual Studio. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Introduction to GitHub:

What is GitHub, and what are its primary functions and features? Explain how it supports collaborative software development.

GitHub is a platform that provides version control using Git,which is a distributed version control system. GitHub offers a range of tools and features that support collaborative software development, project management, and version control.
It has several primary functions i.e
i) Repositories; is a storage space where projects lives. It can contain files, folders, images, videos, spreadsheets, data sets, and virtually anything your project needs.
ii) Branching and merging; Branching is used to develop features, fix bugs, or experiment with new ideas in isolation from the main codebase (usually the main or master branch).
Merging allows for integration of changes from different branches back into the main branch.
GitHub supports collaboration using the following features:
i) Branching and isolation; Developers can work on their own branches independently, reducing conflicts and making it easier to experiment with new features or fix bugs without affecting the main codebase.
ii) Issue tracking and task management; Issues help teams track bugs, enhancements, and tasks, ensuring that nothing falls through the cracks and everyone is aware of what needs to be done.
iii) Community and open source collaborations; it is a platform for open source projects, allowing developers from around the world to contribute to projects. This fosters a collaborative community where anyone can report issues, suggest features, and contribute code.
Repositories on GitHub:

What is a GitHub repository? Describe how to create a new repository and the essential elements that should be included in it.
A repository is a storage space where projects lives. It can contain files, folders, images, videos, spreadsheets, data sets, and virtually anything your project needs.
The process of creating a new repo:
Sign in to GitHub, navigate to new repository page, fill in repository details, initialize the repository, click create repository button to create a new resiporitory.
The essential elements to be included in a repository inlude: Readme file, gitignore file, source code and documentation.
Version Control with Git:

Explain the concept of version control in the context of Git. How does GitHub enhance version control for developers?
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project by keeping track of modifications, resolving conflicts, and maintaining a history of changes.
GitHub is a cloud-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It adds a range of features to Git to enhance version control, collaboration, and project management. The features include; pull requests, remote resiporitory, issue tracking, project management and security permissions.

Branching and Merging in GitHub:

What are branches in GitHub, and why are they important? Describe the process of creating a branch, making changes, and merging it back into the main branch.
Branches are separate lines of development within a repository. Each branch encapsulates its own set of changes, allowing multiple versions of the project to coexist. 
The importances of branching include; collaborations, isolation of work, experimentation and version control.
The process of creating a new brach, commiting and creating pull request
git checkout -b new-feature-branch
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin new-feature-branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

Pull Requests and Code Reviews:

What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request.
A pull request (PR) in GitHub is a feature that allows developers to notify team members that changes are ready to be reviewed and merged into a main branch or another target branch.
They allow team members to review code changes line by line. They can leave comments, suggest improvements, and highlight potential issues.
THey provide a space for discussions related to the changes. Team members can discuss the implementation, ask questions, and provide feedback.
Steps to create and review pull request:
git push origin your-feature-branch
Go to the repository where you pushed your branch.
Click on the "Pull requests" tab.
Click the "New pull request" button.
In the "base:" dropdown, select the branch you want to merge into (usually main or master).
In the "compare:" dropdown, select the branch with your changes.
Add a title and description for your pull request. The description should explain what changes were made and why.


GitHub Actions:

Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows. Provide an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
GitHub Actions is a powerful automation platform that allows you to create custom workflows for your repository. These workflows can be triggered by various events such as pushes, pull requests, or schedule-based triggers. GitHub Actions enable you to automate tasks such as testing, building, and deploying your code.
Custom Workflows: Create workflows to automate tasks.
Event Triggers: Trigger workflows based on GitHub events like pushes, pull requests, issues, and more.
Job Runners: Run jobs on different operating systems and versions.
Integration: Integrate with third-party services and tools.
Marketplace: Access pre-built actions from GitHub Marketplace.
In a repository, create a new directory called .github/workflows.
Inside this directory, create a file named ci-cd.yml.
Open ci-cd.yml and define the workflow as follows;
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pytest

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: test

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          npm install

      - name: Build project
        run: |
          npm run build

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Deploy to server
        env:
          DEPLOY_SERVER: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_SERVER }}
          DEPLOY_USER: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_USER }}
          DEPLOY_KEY: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY }}
        run: |
          scp -i $DEPLOY_KEY -r ./build $DEPLOY_USER@$DEPLOY_SERVER:/var/www/html
